# NumberWizardUI
### Learning Game Development Project 3

NumberWizardUI is a Game developed to play in the Unity console.

The game asks the user to pick a number and then tries to guess it based on the user input.

If the number is Higher then the current guess the user has to press the " Up Arrow Key " or the "Higher Button".

If the number is Lower then the current guess the user has to press the " Down Arrow Key " or the "Lower Button".

If the number is the current guess then the user has to press the " Return/Enter Key " or the "Success Button".

The user can "Quit" the game at any given time by pressing the "Q key" or the "Quit Button".

This project was developed for the better understanding of Unity Engine's Buttons, Scene loading, TextMeshPro and Basics of C#.

This project was developed as a part of the Udemy course "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D" under the guidance of Rick Davidson and Ben Tristem.
